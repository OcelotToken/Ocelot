Ocelot token is a growing decentralized token ecosystem built on the Binance Blockchain aiming to conduct an experiment on economics, trust, and psychology. The experiment is set up to observe the effect of a risky predefined constrained environment presented onto the open market. Over time, Ocelot theorizes that slowly decreasing the inherent risk initially presented will convert the negative sentimental value into trust value.

In the beginning, the Ocelot team learned from other tokens and agrees that there is indeed no greatness without an interesting point of vulnerability. To begin our experiment, the founding team minted Ocelot and reserved 70% of the entire total supply of Ocelot (OCELOT) to a dedicated burn wallet. The team has committed to burning the entire wallet at a variable rate in relation to the previous week’s price action, initiated once a week, until there are no more coins left to burn. 
This is a central part to our experiment. The team would like to see psychological finite supply controls in action within the Ocelot ecosystem. If the price of OCELOT experienced a positive increase in the prior week, the token’s burn rate will be lower than the default. If the price instead experienced a negative decrease from the prior week, the burn rate would be higher than the default.

Please see the graphic that represents our current burn rate schedule.

Looking at our schedule, as an example, if a price of a token was 0.05 at the beginning of one week, and at the end of the week the price ended at 0.06, the percentage gain would be 20%. According to our burn schedule, this would fall under the 12.5% - 25% positive range. The burn rate for that week would be 1.00% of the total supply of Ocelot, or until all the tokens that are reserved for burning run out. 

While we strive to maintain consistency, this burn schedule rate is subject to change at any time. Although the rate of burns may change, these tokens will always be reserved to be burned.

# Risk Analysis

Let's dive a bit more into the risks associated with this experiment.
Taking a look at this particular project from an objective standpoint, it is riskier than others. There are two main components of risk to look at: the tokens in the burn wallet and the liquidity pool ownership percentage.

With an open wallet of 70% of all tokens freely accessible to the founders, the risk is incredibly high with this project. What if the founders were to dump their tokens? What happens if they don't follow their commitment and take a few tokens and sell them on the open market? These are all very possible and valid concerns from someone. What do we have to offer you as recourse for this risk? Nothing but our word that we have an unbreakable commitment to burning all 70% of these tokens. Although we know that is for most people not enough, this is the central part of the experiment. If we pile all the risk of being "rug pulled" into the inception of the token, it is riskiest at inception. As we stay with our commitment to the burn schedule to burn tokens each week, the risk of the founders "taking the money and running" decreases with every burn. We theorize that once we begin nearing an empty burn wallet, the trust and bonds within the community will be so strong as to perpetuate and catapult it into a future of successful decentralized finance.

The other consideration of risk to look at is the liquidity pool ownership percentage. This risk is very similar to the first described above. There is another potential initial "rug pull" risk here where the initial contributors to the liquidity pool that own 100% of it pull liquidity out and drop the token. We believe this risk also diminishes over time. As our community grows from a strengthening bond of trust due to the burn wallet commitment being followed, we believe that there will be people who begin staking and creating liquidity pools all around the decentralized web. Eventually, the original stake in the liquidity pool will begin to matter less and less, until eventually there would be virtually no effect even if the original liquidity were to be withdrawn.

Although there is an incredibly large risk in Ocelot, this is all factored in the from the inception of the token so that inherent risk may only decrease over time. If our experiment goes the way we are expecting to, we will have a strongly bonded community at the end of our token burning period. At that point, we do have a future planned out for Ocelot offerings. We also have an iOS app in beta mode that we plan on releasing depending on the success of our experiment. The app has limited availability upon request to our email at support@ocelottoken.com. 

We thank you for reading about The Ocelot Project!
